# Hi there
This is a personal bot that I made for my own use.  I mainly use it to learn about technologies I'm interested in and sometimes to automate some tasks in the [Chilean Tryouts Server](https://discord.com/invite/tvssYeTwy2).

The code here might not be the best quality, but I try to make it as good as I can. Of course if you want to use it you are free to do so but as it currently is, it is not meant to be used by other people.

The main branch is hosted 24/7 and if you want to invite it the url is [this one](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=570442820704272384&permissions=8&scope=bot). Beware though, this invite link gives the bot full administrator permissions, which it probably doesn't need but I can't be bothered to figure them out right now.

I will probably be adding more information to this readme since if you are seeing this, I made the bot public.

Have a nice day! o/
